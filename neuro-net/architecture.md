# Architecture

By leveraging blockchain, cryptography, LLMs, and edge computing technologies, **Neuro Net** significantly enhances the security, efficiency, and scalability of AI agent services, in a decentralized environment.

**Neuro Net** is composed of the following key modules:

* **AIDA(AI Data Availability) Layer**: Ensures the availability of AI agents by providing robust services for querying, managing, and using AI Agents, as well as offering scalability and composability.
* **L2 Blockchain**: Used for deploying and running decentralized AI applications(AI-Dapps), and provides crypto-native capabilities like smart contracts (compatible with EVM, SVM) and oracles.
* **AI Agent Creator Platform**: Provides tools for AI Agent creators, including development tools and deployment toolchains. We will also integrate existing AI agent tools such as dify.ai, coze.com, langchain, etc.
* [**DePIN Connector**](depin-connector.md): Natively integrates with DePIN, allowing decentralized access to external data interfaces to gather various forms of external feedback.
  * **Storage Module**: Offers storage facilities supporting SQL, NoSQL, vector databases, Filecoin, Arweave, etc, which can be used for external knowledge bases and memories.
  * **Computing Power Module**: Integrates existing decentralized computational power networks such as [io.net](https://io.net) and [Aethir](https://aethir.com), and supports efficient and economical model training, fine-tuning, and inference.
  * **Physical Data Module:** Integrates with real-time physical data sources such as temperature, acceleration, location, and health metrics, allowing AI agents to interact and respond dynamically.
* [**Knowledge Base**](ai-creator-platform/g-kb-gonesis-knowledge-base/)**:** Provides high reliablity, unlimited external knowledge base extensions for AI agents, with privacy protection.
