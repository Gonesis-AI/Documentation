# Delegation

Delegation is the process of authorizing a Checker Node to earn rewards on your behalf using your [Soul Chip](soul-chip.md).

As a Soul Chip owner, you can choose which Checker Node to delegate to. Ensure you delegate to the correct address to avoid penalties for errors or downtime. You can cancel or switch your delegation at any time.

As a node operator, you can accept or decline delegation requests within the Checker Node and end a delegation whenever necessary. Make sure to verify that you are accepting a delegation from the correct owner wallet to ensure you're earning rewards for the correct individual.
