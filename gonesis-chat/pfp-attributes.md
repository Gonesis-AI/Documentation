# PFP Attributes

### Energy&#x20;

Energy is the points consumed in the talk-to-earn process.

* 1 energy point = 1 message
* Energy is recorded under the user's address.
* Energy recovers over time, fully refilling every 24 hours.
* Energy is influenced by the number and quality of PFPs held.

### Quality

The base mining quality of PFP determined by its traits.

* Each PFP under the user's address contributes to the total daily energy.
* The quality of PFPs used as talk-to-earn miner affects $SPK earning efficiency.

### Level

PFP mining level, starting at level 0.

* Levels are tied to PFPs and remain when traded.
* Consume $SPK to upgrade PFP levels, boost mining efficiency, and secure a long-term earning advantage.

### Spirit

PFPs have a spirit attribute that depletes during conversations and requires rest to recover when exhausted.

* Each PFP has spirit. Consuming 1 point of energy for a conversation also consumes 1 point of the PFP's spirit.
* When a PFP's spirit reaches 0, it enters a "Dormant" state and cannot be used for talk-to-earn.
* In the Dormant state, the PFP's spirit gradually recovers over time and exits Dormant when fully restored.
* A dormant PFP can quickly recharge using methods like consuming $GAI.
