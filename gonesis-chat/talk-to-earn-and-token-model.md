## Talk with PFP NFT

At the early stage of Gonesis Chat, **users can only talk with PFP NFT they own.** If you don't have a PFP NFT, you can just acquire one from NFT marketplace like OpenSea and NFTGo, or [rent](pfp-rental.md) from other owners.&#x20;

In other words, PFP is a virtual **miner**, and talking is the process of **mining** for $GAI.&#x20;

But we may also consider removing this requirement in the future.

## Dual Token Model

Gonesis uses a dual-token model with $SPK as the utility token and $GAI as the governance token.

* **$SPK:**  The utility tokens, with an unlimited supply. Only earned through talk-to-earn and consumed in Gonesis Chat.
* **$GAI:** The native and governance token of Gonesis ecosystem, with a fixed supply. $GAI is earned by investing SPK and competing in the reward pool.

### Talk to Earn $SPK

Consume energy to earn $SPK through PFP conversations.

* 1 energy point = 1 message.&#x20;
* Each message earns $SPK at a defined rate determined by the PFP you interact with.
* The reward of each message is divided into two parts:&#x20;
  * **Basic Reward:** Each energy-consuming conversation earns $SPK, boosted by the PFP's Quality and Level (Check [PFP Attributes](pfp-attributes.md)).
  * **Technical Bonus:** High-quality or valuable chats with PFP sometimes bring extra $SPK rewards. Try to trigger more bonus in your conversations!

### Using $SPK to win $GAI

#### $GAI Reward Pool

The $GAI pool is the main way to earn $GAI through $SPK competition.

* Users can invest $SPK to compete for the daily $GAI reward pool; invested $SPK will be burned.
* $GAI earned depends on the user's SPK investment proportion in the pool each round.
* The $GAI pool refreshes daily.

### Utilities of $GAI

$GAI also has a range of utilities in Gonesis Chat:

* The fee for upgrading PFP's Quality.
* The fee for renting PFP
* The fee for creating or customizing AI agent.
* The fee for using an AI agent through [Neuro Net](../gonesis-neuro-net/).
* More features coming soon...
