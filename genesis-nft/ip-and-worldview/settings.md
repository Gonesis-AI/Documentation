## **Theme Story**

Traveler, the one who embarks on a journey.

The world is full of such travelers, each with their own reason to journey: for a bet, for pilgrimage, to find a lost love, to discover themselves. Some simply seek the thrill of a splendid adventure.

Journeys, whether long or short, are never a smooth sail.

To aid the lost, a legendary traveler founded "Gonesis", an organization named after himself, aiding travelers worldwide.

Without form, "Gonesis" extends help through a tiny ring.

\
\
For those eager to embark on their journey, "Gonesis" brings the ring to their side. It will guide travelers' paths, chronicle their experiences, and accompany their journey.

Over time, the Gonesis Ring becomes a traveler's emblem.



Destinations may entice, yet the true wealth lies in the journey itself.

The Gonesis Ring captures every splendid facet of one's travels. Mementos, experiences, images, phrases â€“ each becomes a treasure, preserved within the ring's 'Journey Museum'.

In "Gonesis", every traveler is also a collector, with their unique saga etched in time.



Lost traveler, when you find yourself deeply trapped, please seek help through the ring.&#x20;

The other members of "Gonesis" will receive your confusion, respond to your difficulties, and pave the way for you.

Though travelers in the world rush through their own stories, the paths of each person intersect via this ring, mutually supporting each other to complete the long journey.

When a traveler reaches journey's end, their legend is also preserved in the halls of the Gonesis Ring, serving as a landmark for subsequent travelers, urging them to advance more firmly towards their dreams.
