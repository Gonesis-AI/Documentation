# Neuro Node

**Neuro Node** is a software that runs a super node of Gonesis Neuro Net. It provides worldwide, permissionless, and high-availability AI agent services for users and developers.

Operating a Neuro Node can earn you $GAI and a share of the transaction fees on Neuro Net.

In overview, Neuro Node is:

* L2 blockchain access node,
* Runner of De-AI Agents workflow and API gateway,
* Knowledge base services,
* Network fixed income for incentives,
* Share revenue with creators.

## Node Type

* **Access Node:** This node acts as a gateway to the Neuro Net, providing access to AI Agents. It serves as the primary interface for users, facilitating seamless communication and interaction with AI agent services. Its role is crucial for enabling efficient connectivity to AI capabilities within the Neuro Net.
* **Checker Node:** This node is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of Neuro Net. It monitors and evaluates network operations, performing real-time inspections and validations to ensure compliance with protocols and standards. Its main function is to protect network reliability and prevent unauthorized or malicious activities.

## Requirement

Anyone can run Neuro node, as long as they

* hold a [Soul Chip](soul-chip.md) as the license, or received [delegation](delegation.md) from other Soul Chip owners,
* stake a certain mount of $GAI.

You can run Access Node and Checker Node together or separately in a single instance.&#x20;

**Note that operating an Access Node may result in forfeiture of staked $GAI due to unauthorized or malicious activities. But there is no such risk with a Checker Node.**
