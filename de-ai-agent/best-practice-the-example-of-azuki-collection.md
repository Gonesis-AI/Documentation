## Trait model Guide

To write a trait model for an existing NFT collection, such as the one described for the Azuki NFT collection, you need to structure it to capture both the overarching themes and characteristics of the collection and the specific traits of individual NFTs. The trait model serves as a framework for interactions, ensuring each response is aligned with the distinct identity of the NFT and the culture of the collection.&#x20;

### Who is Eligible to Write Trait Model

Those who control the NFT smart contract or have authorization over the metadata storage network can write and modify the Trait Model. This typically includes the NFT collection’s issuer or the operational team.

### A Typical Prompt Structure

Here’s how to construct such a model:

#### Part 1: Collection Part

This section outlines the general attributes and cultural themes that apply to the entire NFT collection. It sets the tone and backdrop against which individual NFTs operate.Example:

1. Worldview and Culture: Describe the overarching culture of the collection. For Azuki, this includes emphasizing the mystical and vibrant culture that blends anime, streetwear, and Japanese aesthetics. Mention the themes like adventure, exploration, and community spirit that are central to the collection.
2. Common Themes and Values: Identify key themes or values that resonate across all NFTs in the collection, like creativity, individualism, or a sense of adventure. For Azuki, focus on the spirit of community within the universe of the collection.

#### Part 2: NFT Part

This section is specific to individual NFTs within the collection. It details the traits that define the appearance, personality, and behavior of each NFT, ensuring each interaction feels personalized and authentic to that character.Example:

1. Specific Traits: List and describe the specific traits of the NFT, such as hair color, style, clothing, and accessories that visually distinguish it. For the example Azuki, traits include: Hair - Orange, Short, Spiky; Face - Round with Blue Sunglasses; Clothing - Shinto Robe; Eyes - Curious; Mouth - Toothpick.
2. Personality and Interaction Guidelines: Based on the traits, develop a personality profile that will guide how the NFT should interact. For the example Azuki, curious eyes and adventurous accessories like sunglasses suggest a personality that is explorative and bold. This should be reflected in how the AI assistant responds—curious, eager to explore topics, and bold in interactions.
3. Opening Statement: Each NFT should have a unique opening statement that introduces its traits and sets the stage for interaction. For the example Azuki, an opening could be: "Hello, I'm an Azuki with a zest for adventure, clad in my Shinto robe, and ready to explore the digital realm with my curious eyes shielded by blue sunglasses. What mystery can we uncover today?"

By following this structure, you ensure that each NFT’s unique characteristics are highlighted in your responses, maintaining a strong identity that resonates with the collection's theme and the individual traits of each NFT. This model not only enhances user engagement but also deepens the storytelling aspect of the NFT collection.
