# Introduction

## Vision\&Mission

Our vision is **buiding the largest distributed network for AI agents,** that's accessible, transparent, equitable, and creative for everyone worldwide.

Our mission is **to accelerate the mass adoption of AI in a decentralized way.**

## Background

The rise of Artificial Intelligence has led to the emergence of a centralized model ecosystem dominated by proprietary systems. However, the current AI ecosystem faces several serious issues that challenge security and social stability:

1. **Centralized:**The evolution of large AI models increases energy consumption and relies on highly educated individuals. Only large companies can afford these costs, leading to centralization.
2. **Inefficient**: The lack of open infrastructure forces each AI application to create its own AI agent, resulting in duplicated efforts. Additionally, the absence of a market filtering mechanism limits the promotion and reuse of high-quality AI agents.
3. **No Incentive:** The adoption and diversity of AI agents are still in very early stages, with no effective incentives to encourage the creation of various agents for more users.
4. **Unfairness**: Current AI applications target professionals rather than ordinary users, widening the gap in efficiency and quality of knowledge acquisition.

This problems conceals significant drawbacks, including lack of transparency, limited user control, and potential biases, which could be mitigated by decentralizing AI development and deployment.

We believe AI will drive a productivity revolution, while **Web3** will adapt production relationships and solve related issues.

So, we are very eager to introduce features to connect AI with Web3, and transform AI agents to digital assets to genuinely transcend the constraints of the virtual world.

## Our Innovation

We think the most pressing issue at this stage is **how to get users to start using AI in daily life on a large scale.**

So, We're committed to bring these experiences to AI ecosystem**:**

* Create the first [AI chat application](./#chatcoin-the-first-chat-to-earn-ai-chat-application) with a Chat-to-Earn gameplay to attract mass users to engage with AI agents.
* Build [an AI-DA layer and app chain](./#neuro-net) for decentralized AI agents.
* Enable everyone to create high-quality AI agents and earn money in an easier way.
* Enable decentralized AI agents to interact with the physical world via **DePIN**.

## ChatCoin: The first Chat-to-Earn AI Chat Application

[ChatCoin](chatcoin.app.md) is an AI chat application powered by [AI721](de-ai-agent/ai721.md) (AI-NFT) and DePIN, similar to ChatGPT, but with the added benefit of earning token.

All AI characters in ChatCoin are AI-NFTs that you can train, lend, or rent from others to meet everyday needs. Also, we will onboard existing NFT collections to turn into AI characters, enhancing them with more interactive features.

**ChatCoin will be the first product that incentivizes both users and creators, built on** [**Neuro Net**](./#neuro-net)**.**

## Decentralized AI Agents, Powered by AI721

LLMs like Chatgpt with prompts can provide the personality (with knowledge) for AIs, but do not give them the ability to execute tasks. There are lots of SaaS platforms like [dify.ai](https://dify.ai) nowdays, for creating AI agents by composing different APIs from 3rd parties, but all of those AI agents are centralized, close-source and limited to use.

**We're aimed to make every AI agent accessible, easy-to-use and creative for everyone worldwide.**

We make [De-AI](de-ai-agent/) happen by creating an extended protocol AI721 and deploying AI agents on the blockchain based on [NFT(non-fungible token)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/NFT). This encourage the creators/owners of AI agents to continuously hold, develop, and in essence, evolve alongside them.&#x20;

We also enable creators to leverage decentralized computing power for low-cost fine-tuning of pre-trained AI models, achieving personalized and customized AI.

## Creator Economy

In the near future, **AI agent creators** will become a highly paid profession.

We utilize token economy to attract AI agent creators with different knowledge and professional skills, allowing them to create high-quality AI agents in the easiest way, and **enable them to earn money**.

**The better the AI agent you create, the more you earn from it.**

We will also support the existing open-source  AI agent orchestration tools like Dify.ai and CrewAI,  and provide a unified interface for application developers. **Most importantly, developers will pay the creators.**

## Enable AI to interact with Reality

**We aim to invent methods to make real decentralized AI agents**, and allow them to interact with the real world or be influenced by it, a goal that necessitates integration with DePIN.

We'll release a mobile app with a next-gen AI pocket device, [**Gonesis C1**](g-edge/gonesis-c1.md), to let you access all the revolutional experiences. **Gonesis C1** is the first AI device designed for Web3 users, connecting your digital collectibles with the physical world, and let you earn rewards by chatting with your NFT AI in a fun and easy way.

## Neuro Net

[Gonesis Neuro Net](neuro-net/) is the AI-DA(AI data availability) layer and app chain for decentralized AI agents. This is a distributed network with a token economy model.&#x20;

Neuro Net is essential for enhancing AI agents' scalability, and ensuring robustness against centralized control by distributing AI functions across independent nodes. It provides barrier-free access to AI agents, decentralized creation, deployment, and management, DePIN support, integration with DApps, and secure oracles for blockchain data feeds.
