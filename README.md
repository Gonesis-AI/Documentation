# Introduction

## Vision\&Mission

Our vision is **buiding the largest decentralized AI agents network,** that's accessible, transparent, equitable, and creative for everyone worldwide.

Our mission is **to accelerate the mass adoption of AI in a decentralized way.**

## Background

The rise of Artificial Intelligence has led to the emergence of a centralized model ecosystem dominated by proprietary systems. However, the current AI ecosystem faces several serious issues that challenge security and social stability:

1. **Centralized:**The evolution of large AI models increases energy consumption and relies on highly educated individuals. Only large companies can afford these costs, leading to centralization.
2. **Inefficient**: The lack of open infrastructure forces each AI application to create its own AI agent, resulting in duplicated efforts. Additionally, the absence of a market filtering mechanism limits the promotion and reuse of high-quality AI agents.
3. **No Incentive:** The adoption and diversity of AI agents are still in very early stages, with no effective incentives to encourage the creation of various agents for more users.
4. **Unfairness**: Current AI applications target professionals rather than ordinary users, widening the gap in efficiency and quality of knowledge acquisition.

This problems conceals significant drawbacks, including lack of transparency, limited user control, and potential biases, which could be mitigated by decentralizing AI development and deployment.

We believe AI will drive a productivity revolution, while **Web3** will adapt production relationships and solve related issues.

So, we are very eager to introduce features to connect AI with Web3, and transform AI agents to digital assets to genuinely transcend the constraints of the virtual world.

## Our Innovation

We think the most pressing issue at this stage is **how to get users to start using AI in daily life on a large scale.**

So, We're committed to bring these experiences to AI ecosystem**:**

* Create the first [AI chat application](./#gonesis-chat) with a Talk-to-Earn gameplay to attract mass users to engage with AI agents.
* Enable everyone to create high-quality AI agents and earn money in an easier way.
* Enable decentralized AI agents to interact with the physical world via **DePIN**.
* Build [an AI-DA layer and app chain](./#neuro-net) for decentralized AI agents.

## Decentralized AI Agents, Powered by AI721

LLMs like Chatgpt with prompts can provide the personality (with knowledge) for AIs, but do not give them the ability to execute tasks. There are lots of SaaS platforms like [dify.ai](https://dify.ai) nowdays, for creating AI agents by composing different APIs from 3rd parties, but all of those AI agents are centralized, close-source and limited to use.

**We're aimed to make every AI agent accessible, easy-to-use and creative for everyone worldwide.**

We make it happen by creating an extended protocol AI721 and deploying AI agents on the blockchain based on [NFT(non-fungible token)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/NFT). This encourage the creators/owners of AI agents to continuously hold, develop, and in essence, evolve alongside them.&#x20;

We also enable creators to leverage decentralized computing power for low-cost fine-tuning of pre-trained AI models, achieving personalized and customized AI.

## Creator Economy and Open Ecosystem

We utilize token economy to attract AI agent creators with different background, to create high-quality AI agents in a decentralized environment, and make them profitable.

We also standardize interaction rules and make them available to all the other existing NFT projects, so they can create customized real-world interaction rules for their AI-NFTs, with incentives.

To achieve this in a light-weight way, we plan to partner with some notable projects in AI and DePIN area to offer engaging experiences linked to the real world in decentralizied ways.

Also, we will launch a smart hardware in collaboration with hardware partners, integrating exclusive experience into the design of NFT gameplay.

## Gonesis Chat

[Gonesis Chat](./#gonesis-chat) is an AI chat application powered by [AI721](de-ai-agent/ai721.md) (AI-NFT) and DePIN, similar to ChatGPT, but with the added benefit of earning token.

All AI agents in Gonesis Chat are AI-NFTs that you can train, lend, or rent from others to meet everyday needs. Also, we will onboard existing NFT collections to turn into AI agents, enhancing them with more interactive features.

Additionally, Gonesis Chat will be the first ecosystem to incentivize the creators of AI agents.

## Enable AI to interact with Reality

**We aim to invent methods to make real decentralized AI agents**, and allow them to interact with the real world or be influenced by it, a goal that necessitates integration with DePIN.

We'll release a mobile app with a next-gen AI pocket device, [**Gonesis C1**](gonesis-chat/gonesis-c1.md), to let you access all the revolutional experiences. **Gonesis C1** is the first AI device designed for Web3 users, connecting your digital collectibles with the physical world, and let you earn rewards by talking with your NFT AI in a fun and easy way.

## Neuro Net

[Gonesis Neuro Net](./#neuro-net) is the AI-DA(AI data availability) layer and app chain for decentralized AI agents. This is a distributed network with a token economy model.&#x20;

Neuro Net is essential for enhancing AI agents' scalability, and ensuring robustness against centralized control by distributing AI functions across independent nodes. It provides barrier-free access to AI agents, decentralized creation, deployment, and management, DePIN support, integration with DApps, and secure oracles for blockchain data feeds.

If you want to run a super node for Neuro Net, check [here](gonesis-neuro-net/neuro-node/).

## Gonesis NFT

We launch Gonesis NFT to build the first case of our narrative, and accelerate mass adoption of AI technology with Web3 and IP.

* [**Gonesis Ring**](genesis-nft/gonesis-ring.md) (Already minted out):  A 773 NFT collection that serves as a symbol of identity in Gonesis. **It's also the OG pass** with exclusive benefits to the Gonesis ecosystem.
* [**Gonesis Traveler**](genesis-nft/gonesis-traveler.md): 10,000 unique Traveler PFP, the first PFP collection of Gonesis. They are the first batch of virtual characters in [Gonesis Chat](gonesis-chat/).
