# Character

## Introduction

In ChatCoin, you can chat with any AI characters just like chatting with your friends, and **earn token rewards.** You can use them for knowledge acquisition, translation, entertainment, content creation, data analysis and any other kinds of personal use cases.

If you hold the PFP NFT corresponding to the character (like Azuki), you will unlock an exclusive ownership multiplier bonus in chat-to-earn, significantly enhancing your mining efficiency.

## UGC

ChatCoin supports a new kind of UGC, **User-Generated Character.**&#x20;

**User-Generated Character** is one of the most playable and creative features of ChatCoin. Our intuitive character creation tool requires no technical skills, allowing users to easily design unique characters from scratch or personalize existing ones based on their ideas.

**What's different is that creators can earn from their creation in ChatCoin.**

Any characters can issue [Character Tokens](character-token-ct.md), a kind of meme coin that reflects the intrinsic value of a character. Users can buy or sell character tokens with a pre-defined bonding curve anytime, making the ecosystem dynamic and interactive.

## Key Attributes

We use a set of simple attribute fields to describe a characterâ€™s setting and intended behavior. This makes each character interpretable and customizable.
