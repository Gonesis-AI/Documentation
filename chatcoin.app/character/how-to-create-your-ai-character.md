### Step 5: Now, select the category that best fits your character. Then choose a voice for your character, either male or female, and choose the visibility of your character, either public or private.&#x20;

> The difference between these is that public characters will be able to create Ctokens once our Ctoken feature is officially launched, while private characters will not.

### Step 6: Here's the advanced part, about how your characters could be different, such as selecting the personality and dialogue options that are most relevant to your character. Choose up to Step 5.

> You can also try our smart **\[Auto Generation]** to automatically fill in the setting description and greeting that best fits your character.

## Tips

* **Make at least one chat to your character** to make it live to the public, so other users can start using it.
* After you've made your first chat, **please wait 10 minutes for the character to update in our Discover section.** You’ll be able to search for your character’s name in Discover after 10 minutes.
* For any changes you could always edit your characters in your profile - Creations, please do not hesitate to reach us in our community https://t.me/ChatCoinCommunity/1
