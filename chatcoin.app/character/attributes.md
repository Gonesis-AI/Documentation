# Attributes

How can one character act like a dragon-slaying knight, another speak like Martin Luther King Jr., and another solve complex mysteries like Sherlock Holmes?

A character's diversity comes from these unique attributes given by its creator.

### **Name**

The core identifier of character. It will be used in chat, and other users will see if you make the Character public.&#x20;

### **Avatar**

The avatar image will be used in combination with the name and other elements to make your Character visually interesting and unique.

### **Introduction**

**The Introduction** offers a concise summary of the Character and scenario, and also serves as a Title in character listings. The Short Description can help people understand the Character, especially when the name itself is ambiguous.

You can also add up to **3 adjectives or nouns** to summarize a characterâ€™s personality, helping users quickly understand the character.

### Setting Description(Prompt)

**The Setting Description** forms the personalities of the characters. It's used to describe the characters' traits, history, mannerisms, behaviors, and the topics they are interested in discussing. **Ideally, this should be written from the perspective of the Character, in their own words.**

In ChatCoin, we offer two modes for writing long descriptions:

* Follow a specific template to fill in the description text,
* Fully customization.

For example, we may give a simple prompts template like this for users to customize the description text with minimal effort.

<pre class="language-markdown"><code class="lang-markdown"><strong>Act as Nino Nakano:
