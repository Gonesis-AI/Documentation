## Introduction

**CToken,** also **Character Token,** is a native token associated with an AI character, issued through a customizable mechanism by the creator. Imagine friend.tech but specifically for AI Characters.

Characters can issue tokens at an initial price. **The token price adjusts according to a predefined bonding curve**: as more users buy, the price increases. Users can explore fresh characters and identify those poised to become popular. By purchasing tokens early, they support creators and can profit as the character's popularity grows.

## The Type of CToken

CTokens are categorized into two types:

* **Individual CToken**: A dedicated character token issued for a single character. This token will capture and reflect the characterâ€™s value. For example, we'll issue **$ctSatoshi** as the **ICT** for the specific AI character of [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto)(the founder of Bitcoin).
* **Collection CToken**: ChatCoin supports a collection of AI Characters. These characters often share a common worldview with similar design, but each has its own unique traits. **These characters will share the same character token**, to capture the value of any character in the collection and prevent the dilution of purchasing power. For example, we'll issue **$ctAzuki** as the **CCT** for the entire Azuki collection.

## Why We Use Bonding Curve

A bonding curve is a mathematical concept that defines the relationship between the price and supply of an asset. We use bonding curve in ChatCoin because:

1. **Early buyers are encouraged to promote the character they invest in**, to draw in more users to chat with this character. As purchases grow, the price goes up, rewarding these early buyers.
2. Tokens can be bought or sold at any time at the corresponding price, eliminating liquidity risk.

## Benefit for Creators

**A portion of the transaction fees generated from trading CT will be allocated as revenue for the creators**, incentivizing them to continue producing high-quality characters.

## Benefit for CToken Holders

More details are coming soon.
