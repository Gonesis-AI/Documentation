## Introduction

**CToken,** also **Character Token,** is a native coin associated with an AI character, issued through a customizable mechanism by the creator. Imagine friend.tech but specifically for AI Characters.

Characters can issue tokens at an initial price. **The token price adjusts according to a predefined bonding curve**: as more users buy, the price increases. Users can explore fresh characters and identify those poised to become popular. By purchasing tokens early, they support creators and can profit as the character's popularity grows.

## How It Works

Every AI creator can issue character tokens.&#x20;

Each Character token is **FAIR-LAUNCH with no presale and no team allocation**, with a fixed supply of **1 million** and an initial price of **0.001 $TON.** Everyone can buy the token on the bonding curve, and sell at any time to lock in your profits or losses.

### **Graduation**

When the funding reaches **2500 $TON** in total (the token price will be \~0.01 $TON),&#x20;

* **2375 $TON (after a 5% graduation fee)** and the remaining supply will be deposited in STON.FI,
* the LP will be burned so that no one can withdraw the liquidity. This will bring the coin's market cap to **\~11340 $TON (\~$64K).**

### Trading Fee

* Before graduation: 1% for each transaction:
  * 0.5% for creators.
  * 0.5% for ChatCoin,
* After graduation: 0.5% for each transaction:
  * 0.1% for creators,
  * 0.1% for ChatCoin,
  * 0.3% for ston.fi + LP.&#x20;
