## Introduction

The most attractive and innovated features of ChatCoin is that **you can chat with various of AI characters and earn tokens meanwhile.**

If you hold the NFT you're chatting with, you will receive a significant multiplier boost.&#x20;

## Dual Token Model

ChatCoin uses a dual-token model to build a sustainable economy.

* **$SPK:**  The utility tokens(or points) with an unlimited supply.&#x20;
* **$CHAT:** The native token of the ChatCoin ecosystem, with a fixed supply of 1 billion.

## Key Metrics of Chat-to-Earn

### 1. Energy

Each account has a specific maximum number of energy points. Energy is consumed in the chat-to-earn process.&#x20;

* 1 energy point = 1 message.
* Energy is recorded under the user's address.
* Energy recovers over time, fully refilling every 24 hours.
* Energy can be upgraded by consuming $CHAT.

You can check [here](energy-upgrade-table.md) for more details about Energy Upgrade.

### 2. Earning Rate

Each of your character has a base earning rate, **determining how much $SPK you earn per message sent**.&#x20;

When you begin a chat with a character, you create a **unique** **copy** of that character for yourself. To increase your earnings, you can:

* Upgrade the character by spending $SPK and $CHAT to increase your basic earning rate.&#x20;
* Own the NFT of the character you're chatting with. This will give you an exclusive earning rate bonus.

In a word, the actual earning rate = basic earning rate \* ownership multiplier.

### 3. Level

Each of your character starts at level 1. You can consume $SPK to upgrade Character levels, boost earning rate, and secure a long-term earning advantage.

You can check [here](level-upgrade-table.md) for more details about Level Upgrade.

## How To Earn $CHAT

### 1. Chat to Earn $SPK

Consume energy to earn $SPK through chatting with AI.

* 1 energy point = 1 message.&#x20;
* Each message earns $SPK based on a defined EarningRate determined by the character NFT you interact with. The EarningRate is influenced by two factors: level gain and ownership multiplier.
  * **Level Gain:** The main method for boosting EarningRate. Level Gain starts from a lower value and continuously increases as the Character's level upgrades, resulting in a significant boost to EarningRate.
  * **Ownership Multiplier:** By holding the Character's corresponding PFP NFT, your ownership will grant you **an extra multiplier**, boosting your EarningRate accordingly. The ownership multiplier adjusts with the character's level, starting at 2 times.
* Lastly, the reward of each message is divided into two parts:&#x20;
  * **Basic Reward:** Each energy-consuming conversation earns a variable amount of $SPK, based on the Character's EarningRate.
  * **Bonus:** High-quality or valuable chats with Character NFT bring extra $SPK rewards. Try to trigger more bonus in your conversations!

### 2. Depositing $SPK to $CHAT Reward Pool

**The only way to earn $CHAT is to share reward pool by deposting $SPK.**

* Users can deposit $SPK to compete for the regular $CHAT reward pool. **Deposited SPK tokens are one-way and will be burned after each draw.**
* The amount of $CHAT earned is based on the user's share of $SPK in the pool for each round.
* Each $CHAT reward pool lasts several days, **typically on a 7-day cycle.** After the deadline of each round, the pool will immediately distribute $CHAT to each participant based on their shares.

### $CHAT Reward Pool

The $CHAT reward pool is divided into two parts:

* **Basic Reward Pool**: Users compete for $CHAT by depositing $SPK into the reward pool each round. These shares are distributed over five years, with at least 50% of the total $CHAT mined through this pool.
* **Flexible Reward Pool**: A portion of $CHAT is set aside in the Flexible Pool to offer extra token incentives based on user activity with ChatCoin.
